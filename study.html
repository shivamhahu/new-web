      <h2>How to Do Constant Study Without Burnout</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 29, 2025</p>

      <p>Consistency in studying is one of the most powerful habits a student can build — but it’s often misunderstood. Studying for long hours without a strategy can quickly lead to mental fatigue and burnout. Here’s a structured guide on how to maintain constant study with maximum retention and minimal stress.</p>

      <h3>🎯 1. Set SMART Goals</h3>
      <p>Break your study goals into Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound objectives. This avoids overwhelm and gives you clear direction every day.</p>

      <h3>⏰ 2. Use the Pomodoro Technique</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.</li>
        <li>After 4 sessions, take a longer 20-minute break.</li>
        <li>This keeps your brain fresh and engaged throughout the day.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>📚 3. Switch Subjects Periodically</h3>
      <p>Studying one subject for too long can cause fatigue. Try interleaving — switch between subjects or topics every couple of hours to boost comprehension and memory.</p>

      <h3>🧘 4. Prioritize Rest and Sleep</h3>
      <p>Rest is essential to maintain consistent energy. Aim for 7–8 hours of sleep and include 1–2 short naps if you’re studying for extended periods.</p>

      <h3>🍎 5. Maintain Healthy Habits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay hydrated — drink water every 30–60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Eat brain-friendly snacks like nuts, fruits, and yogurt.</li>
        <li>Stretch and move your body during breaks to avoid physical fatigue.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>📝 6. Use Active Recall and Spaced Repetition</h3>
      <p>Rather than passively reading, test yourself using flashcards, mock tests, and summaries. Apps like Anki help space your revision intelligently based on memory performance.</p>

      <h3>🎧 7. Remove Distractions</h3>
      <p>Use productivity tools like Forest, Cold Turkey, or Focus Mode on your device. Study in a distraction-free space with only essential materials.</p>

      <h3>👫 8. Study With a Group or Buddy</h3>
      <p>Accountability can be a game-changer. Studying with a peer helps stay motivated and learn faster by teaching and discussing concepts.</p>

      <h3>💬 Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Constant studying doesn’t mean grinding endlessly. It's about being smart, structured, and balanced. Follow these tips to stay productive, sharp, and stress-free during your study journey.</p>
