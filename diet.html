      <h2>Protein Diets in the Gym: What You Should Know</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 29, 2025</p>

      <p>Whether you're aiming to build muscle, lose fat, or maintain a healthy physique, protein is a key part of your fitness journey. But how much do you need, and what are the best sources? Let’s explore everything you should know about protein diets in the gym.</p>

      <h3>🥩 Why Protein is Important</h3>
      <p>Protein is essential for repairing and building muscle tissues after workouts. It also helps in hormone production, immune function, and maintaining satiety — which makes it easier to manage your weight.</p>

      <h3>💪 Daily Protein Requirements</h3>
      <p>Depending on your goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For general health: 0.8g per kg of body weight</li>
        <li>For muscle maintenance: 1.2–1.6g/kg</li>
        <li>For muscle growth: 1.6–2.2g/kg</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🥚 Top Sources of Protein</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Animal-based:</strong> Chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, whey protein</li>
        <li><strong>Plant-based:</strong> Lentils, chickpeas, tofu, tempeh, soy milk, quinoa, nuts</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🕒 When to Consume Protein</h3>
      <p>Protein timing can make a difference in your results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Post-workout:</strong> Consume 20–30g of protein within 30–60 minutes of your session</li>
        <li><strong>Before bed:</strong> Casein protein or cottage cheese helps with overnight recovery</li>
        <li><strong>Throughout the day:</strong> Distribute protein across all meals for better absorption</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>⚖️ Whey vs Casein vs Plant Protein</h3>
      <p><strong>Whey protein</strong> is fast-digesting and great post-workout. <strong>Casein</strong> digests slowly and is ideal for night. <strong>Plant proteins</strong> are great for vegans but may need blending (e.g., rice + pea protein).</p>

      <h3>🚫 Common Mistakes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Relying only on supplements — focus on whole food first</li>
        <li>Ignoring other macros — carbs and fats are also important</li>
        <li>Not drinking enough water — protein metabolism produces waste that needs to be flushed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>✅ Final Advice</h3>
      <p>A well-balanced protein diet can enhance your performance, boost muscle gains, and accelerate recovery. Plan your meals smartly, stay consistent, and always listen to your body’s needs.</p>
